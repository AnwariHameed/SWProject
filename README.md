# Hospital Management System üè•

1. Project Overview
________________________________________________________________
We are a team of 5 members, studying at the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF). The project we are working on is a Hospital Management System and we use the scrum methodology and the language we will use to develop the project is Java.

2. Objective üßó
_________________________________________________________________

In this project, We need to build a system that help the hospital staff to manage their data. In the first module, we will have a log in page in order to make the system unique and secure from unauthorized users. On the second module, we will have doctor's models. In this model, the user can add the doctor's records. Each doctor will have an ID number which will be a unique number. Then, there will be a view record page where you can view the doctor's records including their name, ID, and specialist. Also, there will be fire doctors and edit doctors page. You can edit or remove doctor records by using their¬†ID¬†number. In the third module, the same system will be for the patient. 

# As mentioned, the application has three modules;
  - Login page 
  - Doctor Record 
  - Patient Admin. 
  
  All the data including doctors and patients are stored in a database. Also, the application has the option to delete or update the patient and doctor's¬†records.
