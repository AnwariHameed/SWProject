# Product Backlog for Hospital Management System üè•

## Introduction
The Hospital Management System is a project by a team of 5 members from the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF). The system aims to help hospital staff manage their data efficiently and securely. This team, with its passion for technology and healthcare, is committed to creating a system that will transform the way hospital staff manage their data.
In the past, the hospital relied on a paper-based system for managing their records. This method, while traditional, presented numerous challenges. Paper records are subject to physical damage and loss. They require significant storage space and managing them can be time-consuming. Moreover, recovering specific information from a pile of documents can be a frightening task, leading to inefficiencies and delays in patient care.
Recognizing these challenges, the team decided to transition from a paper-based system to a digital one. The objective is to create a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly system that can manage large volumes of data with ease. The new system aims to eliminate the problems associated with the old system by digitizing all records, thereby making data management more efficient and less liable to errors.
This project is a demonstration to the team's commitment to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. The team at AUAF is excited about the possibilities this system brings and is dedicated to ensuring its successful implementation. 
## High-Priority Backlog Items
1.	Login Page: Develop a secure login page to prevent unauthorized access.
2.	Doctor Record: Create a module for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting doctor records.
3.	Patient Admin: Develop a similar module for managing patient records.
## Project Overview
The project uses the Scrum methodology and is developed in Java. It consists of three main modules: Login Page, Doctor Record, and Patient Admin. All data, including doctors‚Äô and patients‚Äô records, are stored in a database.

2.	Doctor Record Management: Add, view, edit, and delete doctor records using their unique ID number.
3.	Patient Record Management: Similar features as the Doctor Record module, but for managing patient records.
## Medium Priority Backlog Items
1.	Database Optimization: Ensure efficient and secure storage and retrieval of data.
2.	User Interface Improvement: Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.
Low-Priority Backlog Items
1.	Reporting Feature: Develop a feature to generate reports based on the data.
2.	Feedback System: Implement a system for users to provide feedback on the system.
## Please note that the items in the backlog may be refined as the project progresses. The Scrum Master and Product Owner will play crucial roles in this process. For further information, please get in touch with Qasim Lessani at Qasim.Lessani@auaf.edu.af.
